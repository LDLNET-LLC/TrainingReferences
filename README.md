This repository is for presentations and videos I use in Community Trainings and some of my courses as supplemental documentation for my training classes.
I will continually upload new content as I grow this repository.


Please do not make changes to the content as they are prepared by me for my students and colleagues. If you have questions or wish to add/update content in them, please contact me for assistance.



Thanks and enjoy!

Lance
